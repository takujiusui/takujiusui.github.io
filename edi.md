The under-representation and loss of people from historically excluded backgrounds in academia and science is a reality we must all confront. As my responsibilities and roles as both an educator and researcher continue to grow, I am committed to taking action to ensure a safe and inclusive workspace in which scientific discourse is enriched by a diversity of perspectives and experiences, and ensure that both my teaching and research places inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) at its core (e.g., see ["Teaching Spotlight: Getting to know diverse scientists"](https://blogs.ubc.ca/bionews/2022/03/teaching-spotlight-getting-to-know-diverse-scientists-in-biol-336/)).

I believe that efforts to promote IDEA in research and science must also extend beyond typical higher-education settings. In the past, I have volunteered in school outreach programs as a tutor in education programs serving low-income families. Currently, I am working alongside local non-profit organizations to develop a coding workshop for disadvantaged youth. I am happy to talk about any of my previous and current roles within and beyond academia, and would be very happy to talk to anyone about outreach and IDEA, as I am always seeking to educate myself more on actionable plans we can all participate in.
