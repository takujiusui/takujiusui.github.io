I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding the processes that shape species' ranges and community assembly. Currently, I am particularly interested in the feedback that occurs between evolution and competition (i.e., eco-evolutionary dynamics in communities) and its consequences for population dynamics across space. My research integrates themes from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with [Megan Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto. I completed my PhD with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I completed my undergraduate studies with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh.
