I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding the processes that shape species' ranges and community assembly. Specifically, I am  interested in how rapid feedbacks between evolution and ecology (i.e., eco-evolutionary dynamics) scale up to influence macroecological patterns of biodiversity across space and over time. My research integrates themes from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology using a combination of experimental evolution and data synthesis approaches.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with [Megan Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto. I completed my PhD with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I completed my undergraduate studies with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh.
