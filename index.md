I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in the spatiotemporal dynamics of species' range and niche evolution and its feedback with biotic interactions. My research integrates themes from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology.

I am currently a PhD candidate with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io/people.html) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Edinburgh, working with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home).
