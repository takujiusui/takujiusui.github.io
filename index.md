I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding the eco-evolutionary processes that govern species geographical ranges and community assembly. I use a combination of experimental evolution, experimental field work, and data synthesis approaches to test how the interaction between population genetics and ecology scales up to influence macro-ecological patterns of species distributions and coexistence across space and over time. My research integrates themes from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology.

I am currently a Faculty of Arts & Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow with [Megan Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto. I completed my PhD with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I did my undergraduate research with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh.
