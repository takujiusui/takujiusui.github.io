I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes jointly shape species geographical distributions and community structure, in an era of global change. 

I use a combination of experimental evolution, field work, and data synthesis approaches to test how the interaction between population genetics and ecology scales up to govern: (1) limits and changes to species distributions; (2) spatio-temporal patterns of species coexistence; (3) and evolutionary responses to warming in ecological communities. My research integrates themes and frameworks from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology.

I am currently a Faculty of Arts & Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow with [Megan Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto. I completed my PhD with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I did my undergraduate research with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh.
