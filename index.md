I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in understanding the eco-evolutionary processes that govern species geographical ranges and community assembly. I use a combination of experimental evolution, data syntheses, and field work to test how rapid feedbacks between population genetics and ecology scale up to influence macroecological patterns of biodiversity across space and over time. My research integrates themes from evolutionary biology, population ecology, and community ecology.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with [Megan Frederickson](http://mutualism.ca/) at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto. I completed my PhD with [Amy Angert](https://angert.github.io) at the Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia. I did my undergraduate research with [Ally Phillimore](http://phillimore.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh.
