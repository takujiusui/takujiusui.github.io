The under-representation and loss of people from historically excluded backgrounds in academia and science is a reality we must all confront. As my responsibilities and roles as both an educator and researcher continue to grow, I am committed to taking action to ensure a safe and inclusive workspace in which scientific discourse is enriched by a diversity of perspectives and experiences, and ensure that both my teaching and research places inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA) at its core.

Most of my work in this area so far have been through my active involvement in various mentoring (e.g., via the [Indigenous Undergraduate Research Mentorship program](https://indigenous.ubc.ca/students/research-mentorship/)) and teaching (e.g., see ["Teaching Spotlight: Getting to know diverse scientists"](https://blogs.ubc.ca/bionews/2022/03/teaching-spotlight-getting-to-know-diverse-scientists-in-biol-336/) initiatives. I am also currently serving in the EDI committee of the [Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution](https://csee-scee.ca/advancing-equity-diversity-and-inclusion/) to take active steps towards improving IDEA within Canadian ecology and evolution.

I also believe that efforts to promote IDEA in research and science must also extend beyond typical higher-education settings. In the past, I have volunteered in school outreach programs as a tutor in education programs serving low-income families. Currently, I am working alongside local non-profit organizations to develop outdoor programs and a coding workshop for disadvantaged youth. 

I am happy to talk about any of my previous and current roles within and beyond academia, and would be very happy to talk to anyone about outreach and IDEA.
