### Eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion
Predicting the dynamics of biological invasions and colonizations require an understanding of the eco-evolutionary drivers that influence population spread. Simple models of range expansions state the importance of both demography and dispersal in governing the speed of population spread. However, more recent theory suggest that these processes are further influenced by a suite of other factors including rapid evolution that occurs during population spread, as well as selection from spatially heterogeneous landscapes. <i>We thus require empirical explorations that test predictions of how evolution influences, and is influenced by, range expansions across ecologically complex landscapes.</i>

To explore these ideas, during my PhD, I have established replicated, experimental ranges in the greenhouse using the freshwater angiosperm duckweed as a model organism. Spatio-temporally controlled temperatures within the landscape allow populations to experience selection from an underlying environmental gradient, and both ecological and evolutionary changes are tracked in real-time as replicated populations spread across space.

In a recent working group, we also assessed the deterministic and stochastic outcomes of these eco-evolutionary dynamics on range expansion, and proposed a framework for understanding how these feedbacks might modulate both the mean and predictability of range expansions ([Miller et al. 2020 Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3139))

### Competition and evolutionary rescue at the range-edge
Climate induced shifts in species distributions are altering the strength of biotic
interactions at speciesâ€™ range-edges. As immigrant species colonize newly suitable areas
at their leading-edge to track their climatic niche, they may exert greater competitive effects
on resident species at their trailing-edge for whom the area is climatically deteriorating. Such competition will affect the degree to which resident populations can persist through demographic and evolutionary responses (i.e., rescue) to climate change.

Whilst contrasting theoretical predictions exist for how competition should affect adaptation to
changing environments, we have yet to: (i) experimentally test the mechanisms through
which competition promotes or hinders rescue; and (ii) apply this theory for understanding
the persistence of trailing-edge populations facing the simultaneous stresses of climate
change and increased competition. Using experimental evolution of duckweed communities across a spatial landscape, <i>my projects here aim to empirically test whether and how competition promotes or hinders the rescue of trailing-edge populations</i>.

### Meta-analyses and scientific replicability
Meta-analyses in ecology and evolution can be a powerful tool for synthesizing overarching patterns and generating new hypotheses. During my undergraduate, I conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis to investigate if ecological and geographical drivers could explain some of the variability seen in changes in spring migratory phenology of birds with climate change [Usui et al. 2017 Journal of Animal Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12612). We found that life-history traits such as migration distance was able to explain some of this variation. We also found a phylogenenetic signal in phenological response, although substantial species and spatial variation in phenology remained.

More recently, I have used meta-analyses to explore scientific replicability. In an interdisciplinary collaboration spanning the fields of evolutionary biology (I-DEEL lab, University of New South Wales) and biomedical science (CAMARADES team, University of Edinburgh), we explored the idea that, counter to long-held belief, experimental standardization may actually lead to reduced replicability through generating idiosyncratic effects. We argue the importance of embracing variability in effect-sizes, and suggest that experimental methodologies that generate variability in effect sizes should be incorporated in a systematic manner [Usui et al. 2020 PloS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001009). I am interested in exploring this idea further in ecology and evolution, and would love to hear from any potential collaborators!
