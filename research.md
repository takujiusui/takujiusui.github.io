### Eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion
Recent evidence from empirical and theoretical work suggest a key role of rapid evolution in our ability to predict species' range dynamics. 

The role of environmental heterogeneity on eco-evolutionary dynamics?

During my PhD, I have established single- and multi-species experimental evolution systems using the freshwater angiosperm duckweed as a model organism.
Replicated, experimental range expansions in the greenhouse

I am currently investigating: (1) the dynamics of population spread across spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments


In a recent working group, we also synthesized both the deterministic and stochastic outcomes of these eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and proposed a framework for understanding how these feedbacks might modulate both the mean and predictability of range expansions ([Miller et al. 2020 Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3139))


### Competition and evolutionary rescue at the range-edge
Climate induced shifts in species distributions are altering the strength of biotic
interactions at speciesâ€™ range-edges. As immigrant species colonize newly suitable areas
at their leading-edge to track their climatic niche, they may exert greater competitive effects
on resident species at their trailing-edge for whom the area is climatically deteriorating. Such competition will affect the degree to which resident populations can persist through demographic and evolutionary responses (i.e., rescue) to climate change.

Whilst contrasting theoretical predictions exist for how competition should affect adaptation to
changing environments, we have yet to: (i) experimentally test the mechanisms through
which competition promotes or hinders rescue; and (ii) apply this theory for understanding
the persistence of trailing-edge populations facing the simultaneous stresses of climate
change and increased competition. Using experimental evolution of duckweed communities across a spatial landscape, <i>my projects here aim to empirically test whether and how competition promotes or hinders the rescue of trailing-edge populations</i>.

### Meta-analyses and scientific replicability
I continue to be interested in the power of meta- and comparative analyses.

(1) Conducting a comparative analysis of species' range limits.
(2) During my Honours, I conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis on spring migratory phenology (Usui...)

I also have an interest in reproducible science. Conducting a meta-analysis on improving generalizability.
