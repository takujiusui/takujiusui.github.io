### Eco-evolutionary dynamics of range expansion
During my PhD, I have been establishing a multi-species experimental evolution arena to investigate how eco-evolutionary feedbacks modulate species' range dynamics. Using the freshwater angiosperm duckweed as a model organism, I am currently investigating: (1) the dynamics of population spread across spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments; (2) how eco-evolutionary feedbacks between competition and niche evolution affect species' range dynamics; and (3) the evolutionary limits to species' range.

Recent evidence from empirical and theoretical work suggest a key role for eco-evolutionary dynamics in our ability to predict species' range dynamics. In a recent working group, we synthesized the deterministic and stochastic role of such eco-evolutionary feedbacks and developed a framework for understanding how these feedbacks modulate both the mean and predictability of range expansions (Miller et al. In review @ Ecology).

### Competition and evolutionary rescue at the range-edge
(1) Competition may help or hinder niche and range evolution. Link to coexistence and range limits.

(2) The evolutionary trajectory of coexistence - Collaborating with the Germain Lab.

### Evolution and coexistence


### Meta-analyses and scientific replicability
Interested in the power of meta- and comparative analyses.

(1) Conducting a comparative analysis of species' range limits.
(2) During my Honours, I conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis on spring migratory phenology (Usui...)

I also have an interest in reproducible science. Conducting a meta-analysis on improving generalizability.
