To answer foundational and contemporary questions at the intersection of ecology and evolution, my research uses model plant communities to conduct high-throughput and rigorous experiments in the lab, greenhouse, and using natural field communities.

### High-throughput lab experimental coevolution
In the lab, I use the (co-)evolution of competing duckweed species and their microbial symbionts to experimentally test theories on how population, community, and evolutionary dynamics unfold over space and time in real-time. The rapid generation time of duckweeds (2-7 days) are highly amenable to experimental evolution, and gnotobiotic techniques allow the experimental control and manipulation of host-associated microbial communities. My collaborators and I are currently integrating our robot-operated, imaging system with machine-learning approaches to tracking plant growth and phenotypes across space and over time.

### Large-scale mesocosm experiments
I also conduct large-scale, mesocosm experiments in the greenhouse to conduct common gardens and experimental evolution work involving plant communities at the scale of hundreds of thousands of individuals. I merge these mesocosm experiments with molecular work (population genetic, genomic, and epigenetic approaches) to provide extensive experiments that link molecular mechanisms and processes with ecological dynamics unfolding across multiple scales.
